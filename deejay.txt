Introduction
List comprehensions offer a succinct way to create lists based on existing lists. When using list comprehensions, lists can be built by leveraging any iterable, including strings and tuples.

Syntactically, list comprehensions consist of an iterable containing an expression followed by a for clause. This can be followed by additional for or if clauses, so familiarity with for loops and conditional statements will help you understand list comprehensions better.

List comprehensions provide an alternative syntax to creating lists and other sequential data types. While other methods of iteration, such as for loops, can also be used to create lists, list comprehensions may be preferred because they can limit the number of lines used in your program.
